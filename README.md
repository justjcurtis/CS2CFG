# CS2 Config Repository

> feel free to fork, steal and change this config for CS2

Welcome to the CS2 Config repository! This repo contains my custom configuration files for Counter-Strike 2, including:

- A comprehensive `autoexec.cfg` for general gameplay.
- A `prac.cfg` for practice sessions.
- An `unprac.cfg` to revert practice-specific settings back to default.

This README includes installation instructions, a table of binds and aliases, and an overview of the configs.

```bind "o" "noclip"```
with:
```bind "n" "noclip"```
