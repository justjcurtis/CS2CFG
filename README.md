# CS2 Config Repository

> feel free to fork, steal and change this config for CS2

Welcome to the CS2 Config repository! This repo contains my custom configuration files for Counter-Strike 2, including:

- A comprehensive `autoexec.cfg` for general gameplay.
- A `prac.cfg` for practice sessions.
- An `unprac.cfg` to revert practice-specific settings back to default.

This README includes installation instructions, a table of binds and aliases, and an overview of the configs.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Locate Your CS2 Config Folder**  
   Navigate to the folder where CS2 stores configuration files. By default, it should be:

   **Windows:**  
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`

2. **Download and Add Files**  
   - Download the `autoexec.cfg`, `prac.cfg`, and `unprac.cfg` files from this repository.
   - Place all `.cfg` files into the `cfg` folder.

3. **Run the Configs**  
   - Open CS2.
   - Open the developer console (enable it in settings if itâ€™s not already).
   - Type the following commands to execute the respective configs:
     - `autoexec` is executed every time you open CS2, so either quit and reopen the game or in the terminal type `1` and press enter
     - `prac` load into a competitive practice game on the map you want and then in the terminal type `p` and press enter
     - `unprac/reset` open the terminal and type `r` and press enter to reset any changes made by the `prac` config

with:
```bind "n" "noclip"```
